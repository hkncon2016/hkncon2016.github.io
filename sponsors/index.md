### Sponsorships
[IEEE-HKN](http://hkn.org/) is the honor society of IEEE, the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology, and is dedicated to encouraging and recognizing excellence in the IEEE fields of interest, principally electrical and computer engineering.  
 
The annual Student Leadership Conference is the premier event for more than 150 students, faculty, department chairs, and IEEE-HKN Board of Governors members from around the world to gather for a weekend of professional development, leadership training and networking.

Please email us at corporate@hkn2016.com to discuss partnerships. If you have a proposal for a different type of involvement than the packages below, we'd love to discuss it!

#### Packages
All sponsors receive:

 - a résumé book of the top EE, CE, and CS students throughout the nation
 - their names/logos on the slides and material for the event
